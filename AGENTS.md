# Processing image-arranger Requests

This guide is for a human operator or a coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.) that processes the `requests/*.json` files written by image-arranger.

image-arranger never operates ChatGPT, Vidu, or any generation service directly. The processor reads a request file, performs the work in the generation service's normal UI (or via its own tooling), saves the results, and reports completion back.

## Request Files

Default location:

```text
<workspace>/requests/*.json
```

Process a target when:

- the request `status` is `requested`, and
- the target `status` is `requested`.

Target actions:

- `action` missing or `generate` — create a new image or video.
- `action: "improve"` — regenerate based on an existing asset.
- `action: "analyze"` — image analysis for the base kit. **No image is generated.**

Never process targets or requests whose `status` is `cancelled`.

## Image Generation (`generate`)

1. Use the target `prompt` as-is.
2. If `inputs.refImages` is present, attach only those files. They contain assets the user explicitly adopted (or the improvement source). Do not add other candidates on your own.
3. Treat **1 queue target = 1 deliverable**. Do not produce grids, contact sheets, A/B comparisons, or multiple candidates for a single target.
4. Save the result into the target `outputDir`.
5. Register the file as an asset candidate on the matching entry (via the UI or `POST /api/assets`), marking `adopted` only if the user asked for auto-adoption.
6. Mark the target completed (see Reporting below).

## Image Improvement (`improve`)

Same as generation, but treat `inputs.sourceAsset` / `assetFile` as the primary reference and follow `improvementPrompt` as the improvement intent.

## Video Generation (`generate` with frames)

1. Pass `inputs.startFrame` and `inputs.endFrame` to the image-to-video service.
2. Use the target `prompt` as the motion prompt.
3. Generate one video first; check frame fidelity, locked camera, single action, and no extra objects before retrying.
4. Save into `outputDir` and register the asset.

## Base Kit Analysis (`analyze`)

1. The deliverable is JSON, not an image.
2. Attach the single image in `inputs.refImages` and send the target `prompt` to the analysis service.
3. Extract the JSON code block from the reply. Shape:

   ```json
   { "character": "...", "parts": [{ "key": "...", "label": "...", "category": "...", "prompt": "..." }] }
   ```

4. Return it to the running server:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4217/api/requests/complete \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"requestId": "<requestId>", "targetIndex": 0, "parts": <the JSON>}'
   ```

   The server marks the target completed and materializes one base entry per part, with the source image attached as an adopted `source-reference`.
5. If you cannot reach the server, report the JSON verbatim; the user can paste it into the "Create kit" tab.
6. If a part `prompt` is missing the single-deliverable / no-redesign / isolated-part rules, fix the JSON before returning it.

## Reporting Completion

Preferred — call the API while the server is running:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:4217/api/requests/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"requestId": "<requestId>", "targetIndex": 0, "results": [{"file": "<saved path>"}]}'
```

Fallback — edit the request JSON directly: set the target `status` to `done`, fill `results`, and update the request `status` when no `requested` targets remain.

## On Failure

- Do not silently retry the same request, and do not substitute screenshots, cached files, or internal blob URLs for a real export.
- Set the target `status` to `error` with an `errorMessage` explaining what failed in the normal procedure.
- Report what user action or prompt change is needed next.
